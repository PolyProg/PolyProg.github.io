# Santa's Algorithmic Challenge

Ho ho ho! Santa decided to pass by EPFL before Christmas, to judge nice students based on their algorithmic performance.

The Challenge is organized by Prof. Kapralov, in collaboration with PolyProg and Yandex.  
It is focused on Bachelor students, specifically those in second year taking the "Algorithms" class, but open to all EPFL students.

## Rules

**Your goal** in the challenge is to solve as many tasks as possible, while having fun.

**You are eligible** to participate only if you are a student at EPFL, including exchange students and PhDs.  
Bachelor students may be prioritized if there are too many registrations.

**Programming tasks** will be there for you to solve.  
Each of them requires you to find the right algorithm and implement it in a short program.

**1 point** is what you get for each completely solved task.  
A task is completely solved when your program produces the right output for all test cases, within the time limit.

**Time and wrong submissions** are used to rank teams that solved the same number of tasks.  
Total time is a tie-breaker, where less is better; it is the sum of all intervals from the contest beginning to a correct submission.  
Each incorrect submission gives you a 20 minute penalty.

**3 hours** is the duration of the contest.

**1 PC** per team is allowed.

**Cheating** is when you try to communicate with other teams, access unauthorized websites, or mess with the contest.  
You shouldn't do this. Otherwise, Santa might put you in his bag and take you with him.
