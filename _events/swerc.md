# ACM ICPC Local Selection

The [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/), or ACM ICPC for short, is the biggest student programming contest in the world.
Teams first go through a regional final, and the top teams go on to the world finals.

Every year, PolyProg looks for six talented EPFL students to represent EPFL at the regional final, the [Southwestern Europe Regional Contest](https://swerc.eu/).  
These six programmers make up two teams at SWERC. 

In order to find them, we hold a selection contest.  
The contest rules are simple: contestants are given a set of problems (e.g. dynamic programming, graph algorithms, divide/conquer, ...)
and must solve as many of them as possible in the given time.

The selection contest in the 22/23 academic year will be held on **December 10, 2022 from 9:00 to 17:30 in CO5**. The contest will last 5 hours.
[Register now](https://forms.gle/VJNNkErk2xmca4Hq7)!

Schedule:    
9:00 : Check-in    
9:30 : Introduction    
9:40->10:40 : Practice Contest    
11:00->16:00 : Contest (Scoreboard Freezes at 15:00)    
16:15 : Closing ceremony    
16:30 : Ap√©ro    

The contest is open to all EPFL students.    
Among the best students satisfying the ACM-ICPC eligibility criteria, 6 people will be selected to represent EPFL at this year's regional contest SWERC which will take place in Milano, Italy from 17/02/2023 to 19/02/2023.
