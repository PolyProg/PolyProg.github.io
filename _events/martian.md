# Martian Challenge

The Martian Challenge is a programming contest for first-year IC students at EPFL.

During the span of a few hours, you are given a set of problems to solve in a team of 2 (you can also be alone if you wish).   
Your task is to understand those problems, solve them by implementing your solution in a short program,
and most importantly to have fun!

You do not need to know algorithms, or anything beyond the basic programming curriculum from the first semester.

Every problem solved gives you one point; in case of a tie, teams are ranked based on the time it took them to solve problems,
and the number of wrong solutions they submitted.
