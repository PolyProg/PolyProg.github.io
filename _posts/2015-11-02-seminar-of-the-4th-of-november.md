We are having another problem solving seminar this week, on Wednesday, November 4, at 18:15 in INF3. This time we will tackle more complicated problems. We'll use the problems D, G and H from the previous Selection Contest problem set. If you need access to the problem, please contact president.polyprog@epfl.ch (the problem set is not public). Jakub Tarnawski will go through these three problems and explain how you can solve them within the time constraints. Hope to see you there!
