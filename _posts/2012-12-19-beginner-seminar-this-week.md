title: Beginner seminar this week
---

as a further seminar of our beginner seminar series, Nikolay will explain to you the very basic algorithms when it comes to [graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29), Breadth- and Depth-First-Search. You will learn how to implement graphs and how to traverse them using these methods and will solve some basic tasks related to these algorithms. We will in later seminars build up on that knowledge to develop more complex graph algorithms. See you on Thursday, 18:15 in BC 07/08.
