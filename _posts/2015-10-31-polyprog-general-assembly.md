title: PolyProg general assembly
---

Following the general assembly on 14 October 2015 (a detailled report can be found in the statutes page), a new committee has been elected : 
* Christian Zommerfelds (President)
* Solal Pirelli (Vice President)
* Simon Meinhard (Treasurer)
* Valérian Rousset (HC2 coordinator)
* Angelina Steffens (Member of committee)
* Joey Zennhäusern (Member of committee)
* Wajeb Saab (Member of committee)

PolyProg would like to thank the former treasurer, Jonas Wagner, who contributed in an outstanding way to the association for many years!

Furthermore, we have decided to abolish membership fees. However, we will accept donations from people who also want to contribute in a financial way.

Finally, this year, there might be two new exciting events, so stay tuned! :-)
