Do you think you have got what it takes to represent EPFL at the [Southwestern Europe Regional Contest](http://swerc.up.pt/2015/) in Porto?
Then [register](http://swerc.hc2.ch/) quickly and become one of six lucky coders to travel to Portugal this November.

The Selection Contest is an algorithmic programming contest. Microsoft will be sponsoring this year's event and throw in some cool prizes, among them an Xbox for the best participant at the selection contest. Microsoft will give a tech talk about Big Data.

We will expect you on the 10th of October, 10:00 in front of INF3. Snacks and Drinks will be provided.

See you there!
