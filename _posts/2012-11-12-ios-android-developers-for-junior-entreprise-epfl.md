title: iOS/ Android developers for Junior Enterprise EPFL
---

do you have experience in iOS/Android development? Do you want to expand it while making money?

Junior Enterprise EPFL is an association that helps companies who want to launch small projects find students to do it. Recently, a lot of projects are about mobile app development, and Junior Enterprise is looking for people with knowledge in that domain. Current or prospective projects range from static information display over QR code applications to bluetooth networking! And I hear the pay can be significantly better than what you get as teaching assistant ;) .
