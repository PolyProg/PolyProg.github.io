Do you think you have what it takes to represent EPFL at the ACM ICPC [SouthWestern Europe Regional Contest](http://swerc.up.pt/2016/), and maybe go on to win the world finals?

Or do you just want to discover algorithmic contests and test your skills?  
That's fine too!

PolyProg is organizing the selection contest for SWERC on Saturday, October 8 at 10:00 in INF 2/3. Please [register](http://swerc.hc2.ch/) if you're interested.
