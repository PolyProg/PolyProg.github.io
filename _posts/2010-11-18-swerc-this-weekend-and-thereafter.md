title: SWERC this weekend... and thereafter?
---

This weekend, as you might know, the first part of the PolyProg year will conclude with our participation in the SWERC.

But what will happen next? Well, no need to worry, we have something to play around with for all of you: We are going to participate in CodeCup 2011!

For that we will be working on an artificial intelligence for a game.

Curious? Then come to our seminar on the 25th of November at 18:15 in BC07/08!
