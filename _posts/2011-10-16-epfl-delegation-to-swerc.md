title: EPFL delegation to SWERC
---

Kudos to all 38 contestants who acted in our thrilling joint EPFL/ETHZ selection contest. At the end of the day, there could be only 6 students to represent the colours of EPFL at the regional finals of the ACM ICPC in Madrid on November 19-20. 

The 6 candidates are (ordered by their rank in the contest): Cheng Zhong, Tran Le Hung, Talau Cristian, Johannes Wuthrich, Mihai Moraru and Przemyslaw Pietrzkiewicz. As back-ups qualified Robin Steiger and Octavian Ganea. 

The selection committee will announce the final constellation of the 2 EPFL teams (with 3 contestants each) after next week's training camp at ETHZ. 

Last but not least, we'd like to emphasize the exceptional performance of Andrei Giurgiu, who finished as best EPFL student and 2nd overall!
