title: From brute-force to elegance seminar [April 7th]
---

PolyProg launches its series of spring seminars this April 7th.

At this 1st seminar we teach you how to properly brute-force and then tune your code tremendously via fantastic tricks! 

There will be some theory, and a lot of practice! By implementing the codes yourselves during the seminar, you get the best of it!

The overall goal of this seminar series is to prepare you for the selection contest (early October) to SWERC 2011 in Madrid, for which we hope to get some fresh blood into the team. We'll continue then with advanced seminars for proper preparation of SWERC in October and November.

Place: **BC07/08**  
Time: **April 7th, 18h15-20h00**  
Keywords: **Brute-force, dynamic programming, search pruning, hands-on**
