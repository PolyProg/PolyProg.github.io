PolyProg is a **competitive programming** association at EPFL.

We promote the interests and skills in competitive programming within EPFL.  
We train EPFL students for international contests, such as the ACM ICPC.  
We organize contests, both for EPFL students and the whole of Switzerland.

Whether you're a novice or an experienced competitive programmer, if you enjoy algorithms, we're here for you!

If you're interested in helping us organize events, there's always something cool to do! [Contact us](/about)!
