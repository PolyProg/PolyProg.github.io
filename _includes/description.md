PolyProg is a **competitive programming association** at EPFL.

We promote the interests and skills in algorithms within EPFL. 
We train EPFL students for international contests, such as the ACM ICPC.  
We organize events, both for EPFL students and the whole of Switzerland.

Whether you're novice or experienced, if want to have fun solving algorithmic puzzles, we're here for you!

If you're interested in helping us organize events, there's always something cool to do! [Contact us](/about)!
