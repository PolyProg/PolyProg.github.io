# PolyProg Website

This is the website of the PolyProg student association at EPFL, Switzerland.

## Updating this website

The parts that are intended to be changed are:

- `_posts`, contains all news;
- `_events`, contains our events;
- `_people`, contains our committee;
- `_results`, contains EPFL results at ACM ICPC.
- `_includes/*.md`, the texts used on the website.

The `images` folder has subfolder for items that require images; same for the `pdf` and `zip` folders.

No other file should need changing for normal operation.

Check out past commits for examples of news.
